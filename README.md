# Meow-Bot
    This is a discord bot which includes, sending a card in a specific channel to anyone who joins the server, a few fun commands, an anime search command, and there is anime recommendation command too. More commands will be added as I develop it. Feel free to help if you can.

# HOW TO SETUP THE BOT
    Well setting up the bot is pretty easy.
> First, download and upload the files of the bot to your pc or vps wherever you want to host the bot.
> Second, Get your Discord Bot token and put it in the ".env" file.
> Open the "main.py" and setup your bot file and change the channel id to your channel ID where you want the bot to send welcome message.
> After that u need to install the required libraries, you can do this by\n
        ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```\n
> Now you are all setup. Just run the main.py file. The bot should be online and working now.
